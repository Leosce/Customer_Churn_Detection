# Customer Churn Prediction

## Introduction
Customer churn prediction is the process of identifying customers who are likely to cancel their subscription to a service based on their usage patterns and behaviors. It is a critical task for businesses, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model to determine whether a customer is likely to exit (churn) based on historical data about their behavior and interactions with the service. The insights generated by the model will enable businesses to take proactive measures to retain customers and reduce churn rates.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `Churn_Modelling.csv`, which includes various features related to customer demographics, financial behavior, and service engagement.

### Features:
- **RowNumber**: Row index of the data (used for reference only).
- **CustomerId**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Surname**: Customer's last name.
- **CreditScore**: Customer's credit score.
- **Geography**: Customer's geographic location.
- **Gender**: Customer's gender.
- **Age**: Customer's age.
- **Tenure**: Number of years the customer has been with the company.
- **Balance**: Customer's account balance.
- **NumOfProducts**: Number of products the customer uses.
- **HasCrCard**: Whether the customer has a credit card (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- **IsActiveMember**: Whether the customer is an active member (1 = Yes, 0 = No).
- **EstimatedSalary**: Customer's estimated annual salary.

### Label (Target):
- **Exited**: Indicates whether the customer has exited the service (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

## Project Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the data to understand the distribution of features and identify patterns related to customer churn.
3. **Feature Selection**: Select the most relevant features for the predictive model.
4. **Model Building**: Train and evaluate different machine learning models to predict customer churn.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
6. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the best-performing model for real-time prediction of customer churn.


## Workflow

### Reading the Dataset
1. **Load the Dataset**: Load the `Churn_Modelling.csv` file using a library like pandas.
2. **Data Exploration**: Perform data exploration to understand the dataset, check for missing or inconsistent values, and get a general sense of the features.

### Data Visualization
1. **Visualize Numerical Features**: Create visualizations for the distribution of numerical features such as Age, CreditScore, Balance, and EstimatedSalary.
2. **Visualize Categorical Features**: Visualize categorical feature distributions such as Gender and Geography.
3. **Correlation Heatmap**: Create a correlation heatmap to identify relationships between features.
4. **Target Variable Distribution**: Visualize the distribution of the target variable (Exited) to check for class imbalance.

### Feature Engineering
1. **Encode Categorical Features**: Process non-numerical columns such as Geography and Gender by encoding them into numerical values (e.g., using One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding).
2. **Ensure Clean Features**: Ensure all features used in the model are clean, relevant, and properly formatted.

### Splitting the Dataset
1. **Split the Dataset**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% for training and 20% for testing) using tools like `train_test_split` from `sklearn`.

### Oversampling (if needed)
1. **Balance Classes**: If the dataset is imbalanced (e.g., significantly fewer customers who exited), use techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance the target classes.

### Feature Standardization
1. **Standardize Features**: Standardize the features so that they are on the same scale (e.g., mean = 0, standard deviation = 1). This step is particularly important for algorithms like SVM and KNN.

### Model Evaluation
1. **Train and Evaluate Models**: Train and evaluate the following algorithms:
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Naive Bayes
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Decision Tree (DT)
2. **Fit and Evaluate**: Use the training set to fit the models and the testing set to evaluate their performance.

### Comparing Algorithms
1. **Compare Models**: Compare the models using evaluation metrics such as:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision and Recall
   - F1-Score
   - ROC-AUC Score
2. **Identify Best Model**: Identify the best-performing model based on the overall evaluation.
